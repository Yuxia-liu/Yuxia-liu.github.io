<br>I developed a passion for hiking this year, finding it an incredibly engaging activity. It’s a perfect blend of discovering diverse scenic beauties and getting physical exercise—each trail unfolds unique landscapes, from lush forests to rugged peaks, while every step strengthens my body. What I love most is high-altitude hiking. There’s an exhilarating thrill in feeling my heart rate quicken as I ascend, and the experience somehow melts away stress, leaving me refreshed and grounded. It’s more than a hobby; it’s a way to connect with nature and reset my mind.

<br>Travel has always been a beloved passion of mine. I’m drawn to the joy of immersing myself in the unique customs and cultures of different cities—each place tells its own story through local traditions, dialects, and daily rhythms. What makes these journeys even more special is savoring distinctive local cuisines, from street food stalls serving aromatic snacks to family-run eateries with secret recipes passed down generations. Sharing these moments with friends turns ordinary trips into unforgettable memories: laughing over a meal, getting lost in a historic alley, or marveling at a unexpected sunset together. For me, travel isn’t just about visiting new places; it’s about collecting experiences that enrich the heart and broaden the mind..



## Past Hobbies

I used to be really fond of playing badminton. There was something thrilling about the quick rallies, the sound of the shuttlecock hitting the racket, and the rush of scoring a point. It was not just a sport but a fun way to stay active and connect with others. Unfortunately, I haven’t played in a long time. Finding people to play with and having access to a proper court have been hard to come by, and that’s kept me away from this once-loved hobby.
